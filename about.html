        <h1>A New Path Forward</h1>
        <p>Hey McMaster!</p>
        <p>While I initially only came to this University because of the gothic architecture and a strong distaste for commuting to downtown Toronto, the past few years have proven that I made the right choice. The people, experiences and joy I've been a part of on campus have been lifetime highlights. Our campus events, my endless innertube water polo playoff losses, working with the MPSSA, and my provocative work with <i>The Sil</i> have gratefully immersed me into what makes our University so special. The people.</p>
        <p>That's a big part of why I'm running. While turnouts have crept up during my time here, most folks I talk to remain indifferent or uniformed concerning the MSU's services and are unaware of how much more we could be doing. As a result, my platform centralizes giving a voice to campus to reignite our engagement and vibrancy.</p>
        <p>Beyond the university I've had an amazing time working in Archeology on the outskirts of Hamilton, toiling all summer for a single pottery sherd. It's emotionally unforgiving work for those interested.</p>
        <p>When I'm not analysing MSU governance structures, I often play electric guitar, to the dismay of my housemates, read literature which is far beyond my skill level and spend far too much money on going out.</p>
        <p>Me and the team have already had such an amazing time working on this campaign so thank you all for the opportunity to put my hat in the ring.</p>
        <p>Stay in school,</p>
